#### About
This Web Application is solely made to test my full stack development skills. The goal was the create a fully functional E-commerce application without relying too heavily on third party code / dependencies.
For the front-end, only React is being used as a javascript libarary. For the back-end, NodeJS, Express and Pg are being used. Pg is a PostgreSQL client for NodeJS and is used to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
